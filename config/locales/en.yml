  about_para1: "Quite simply, e-learning is electronic learning, and typically this means 
                using a computer to deliver part, or all of a course whether it's in a school, 
                part of your mandatory business training or a full distance learning course."
  about_para2: "In the early days it received a bad press, as many people thought bringing 
                computers into the classroom would remove that human element that some learners 
                need, but as time has progressed technology has developed, and now we embrace 
                smartphones and tablets in the classroom and office, as well as using a wealth 
                of interactive designs that makes distance learning not only engaging for the 
                users, but valuable as a lesson delivery medium."
  about_para3: "Building partnerships with quality training providers, and combining this with
